## Quick Start

Scaffold a new project by running these commands:

```
$ curl -L https://github.com/dynamit/front-end-boilerplate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1
$ npm run setup
```

After the setup is compete, update the README with your project's info.


## Local development

Start a local development environment:

```
$ npm start
```

This will compile files, then watch for changes to recompile.

This will also start a server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) that will live-reload when changes are detected.

## Build for distribution

```
$ npm run build
```

In addition to the standard build tasks, this minifies CSS and uglifies JavaScript.

## Configuration

Configuration values are defined in the `config` object in `gulpfile.babel.js`

Available options, with defaults shown:

```javascript
templates: {
	src: ['src/templates/**/*', '!src/templates/+(layouts|components)/**'],
	dest: 'dist',
	watch: ['src/templates/**/*', 'src/data/**/*.json'],
	layouts: 'src/templates/layouts/*',
	partials: ['src/templates/components/**/*'],
	data: 'src/data/**/*.{json,yml}'
},
scripts: {
	src: './src/assets/scripts/main.js',
	dest: 'dist/assets/scripts',
	watch: 'src/assets/scripts/**/*'
},
styles: {
	src: 'src/assets/styles/main.scss',
	dest: 'dist/assets/styles',
	watch: 'src/assets/styles/**/*',
	browsers: ['last 1 version']
},
images: {
	src: 'src/assets/images/**/*',
	dest: 'dist/assets/images',
	watch: 'src/assets/images/**/*'
}
```

### Definitions

#### {task}.src 
 
Type: `String` or `Array`  
Source files for task.

#### {task}.dest

Type: `String`  
Output destination.

#### {task}.watch

Type: `String` or `Array`  
Files that should trigger recompilation/reload when changed.

### templates.layouts

Type: `String` or `Array`  
Layout templates.

Layouts are wrappers for template content. Templates are inserted into layouts at the `{% body %}` tag.

### templates.partials

Type: `String` or `Array`  
Partial templates.

### templates.data

Type: `String` or `Array`  
Data that can be used when templating pages. Can be either JSON or YAML.

### styles.browsers

Type: `Array`  
Value passed to [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#browsers)

## Template Assembly

Templates are assembled using [fabricator-assemble](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator-assemble).

There are number of [options](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator-assemble#options) available, particularly the ability to define your own Handlebars helpers.

### Custom Helpers

[Helpers](http://jaskokoyn.com/2013/08/08/custom-helpers-handlebars-js-tutorial/) can be define as a object, where the key is the name of the helper and the value is a function.

```javascript
assemble({
	helpers: {
	    markdown: require('helper-markdown'),
	    foo: function () {
	        return 'bar';
	    }
	}
});
```

## PostCSS vs SASS
The `gulpfile.js` includes two `styles` tasks; one for SASS compilation and one for [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) compilation. You may choose to use either processor by simple commenting out/deleting the one you do not want.

**SASS is the default in the** `gulpfile.js`


## Unit Testing

This version of the Front End Boilerplate is configured with Karma and Jasmime for unit testing. A sample test has been set up in `tests/addition.spec.js`. After you've create a JS module in `src/assets/scripts` and have imported it into `main.js`, you can create the module's matching `.spec.js` file under `tests/`.

Once you've written your unit test, you can start the test by running the command: `karma start`

After running your tests, coverage reporting will be available under `build/reports/coverage/report-html/index.html` (which you then open into a browser).
